# Asteroids 3D
This is a reinterpretion of the classic retro Asteroids in 3D. The game runs in a browser using WebGL and has been developed with the three.js.

## How to run
Just open the index.html with any live server extension of your choice. All necessary files and libraries are already included in this project.


## The Goal
Destroy all Asteroids before the timer runs out. Beware that shooting large asteroids splits them in smaller fragments which are faster and more difficult to hit! 


## Controls
__W__ = hold to accelerate

__S__ = hold to decelerate

__Move Mouse__ = turn the ship

__Spacebar__ = shoot forwards
